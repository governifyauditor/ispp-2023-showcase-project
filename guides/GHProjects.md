# Github Projects config

## Create GitHub Project
First you need to enter to your GitHub repository and go to the `Projects` tab. If it does not appear you might need to go to the `Settings` tab and enable them.  

Once you are in, you will need to click `New project` on the right side of the screen.

Choose a name and a description for your project and click on `Create project` without selecting a template. 

## Add columns to your project
We will create 4 columns to store the issues and define a workflow. Click on `Add column` to enter the form.

The four columns must be called `Backlog`, `In progress`, `In review` and `Done`. We will not be using any automation.

The project should look like this:

The columns names are mandatory and case sensitive so make sure again they are called exactly as said. If not, you should delete the column and recreate it again.
