# Github Projects config

## Create GitHub Project
First you need to enter to your GitHub repository and go to the `Projects` tab. If it does not appear you might need to go to the `Settings` tab and enable them.  

Once you are in, you will need to click `New project` on the right side of the screen.

## Add an "In Review" column to your project

Once created, click on the `+` button to add a new column and name it "In Review". Optionally, you can place it right between the "In Progress" and the "Done" columns. 

It is vital that there exists 3 columns named exactly as follows: `In Progress`, `In Review` and `Done`. Otherwise, data will not be gathered.

The project should look like this:
